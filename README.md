## üöÄ How to Use

### For Linux

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mgmehra2005/Yt-Spoof.git
    cd Yt-Spoof/Linux
    ```

2.  **Make the Script Executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x yt-spoof.sh
    ```

3.  **Configure Spotify (Crucial\!):**
    Open the `yt-spoof.sh` file in your favorite text editor and uncomment the lines for `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Spotify application credentials.

    ```bash
    # export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID"
    # export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET"
    ```

    *If you don't have Spotify API credentials, you'll need to create a Spotify Developer account and an application to get them.*

4.  **Run the Script:**

    ```bash
    ./yt-spoof.sh
    ```

### For Windows

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mgmehra2005/Yt-Spoof.git
    cd Yt-Spoof/Windows
    ```

2.  **Run the Script:**

    ```bash
    ./yt-spoof.bat
    ```

    *If you don't have Spotify API credentials, you'll need to create a Spotify Developer account and an application to get them.*


    The script will then guide you through the options for downloading YouTube videos/audios or Spotify audios.
